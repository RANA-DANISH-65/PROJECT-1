                <h2>New Build Homes</h2>
                <p>
                  We can provide a turnkey package to construct a new build
                  home. We are happy working closely with clients and architects
                  to form a robust, well-informed team to move the project
                  forwards with no surprises. Whether it is a traditional or
                  contemporary new build home in Lancashire that you are looking
                  for we can help.

                <h2>House Extension</h2>
                <p>
                  Extending your home can often be a less costly and stressful
                  option than moving to a new property. You can take the
                  opportunity to change the layout and make the building to work
                  better for you. We will guide you every step of the way with
                  your house extension. If required we know some great
                  Architects who can help design the space, apply for planning
                  permission and produce detailed plans.

                <h2>House Renovation</h2>
                <p>
                  House renovation projects breathe new life into tired homes.
                  We have significant experience working with listed buildings
                  and ones within Heritage and Conservation areas. We use
                  building techniques that are sympathetic to the building. You
                  can update the layout to create better spaces. Make structural
                  changes or perhaps just modernize what already exists. There
                  are endless possibilities for completely changing the look,
                  function, and feel of your house renovation project.

                <h2>Property Development</h2>
                <p>
                  We are actively seeking properties with development potential.
                  Also, land which may pose the opportunity for new build
                  projects. Particularly we are looking for projects in the
                  Chorley and Lancashire areas. We will also consider
                  opportunities which are further afield. Our aim is to produce
                  unique and interesting properties built with care. If you have
                  a property or land you would like to discuss then please get
                  in touch.

                <h2>Landscaping & External Works</h2>
                <p>
                  Hard landscaping projects create an interesting outside area
                  to your property and will add to its value. You can include
                  Paved Areas, Bound Aggregate Paths with Timber, Concrete or
                  Brick Edging, Rock & Stone Features, Pergolas & Shelters,
                  Ponds & Water Features. Additionally, driveways and paths in a
                  multitude of finishes, all carefully built to a high standard.

                  scope. We are capable of delivering small to medium-sized
                  projects which may include office or restaurant
